# curaitor — AI-Powered Article Discovery, Triage & Review

An article reading assistant that automates discovery and triage while keeping you in the loop for what matters.

## Commands

- `/cu:triage` — Process Instapaper saves: fetch, evaluate, route to Obsidian, archive
- `/cu:discover` — Surface new articles from RSS feeds with semantic relevance evaluation
- `/cu:review` — Interactive review: browse Review queue in cmux browser, discuss, give verdicts
- `/cu:read` — Deep reading: read Inbox articles with full summary, RAG discussion, save or discard
- `/cu:review-ignored` — Check Ignored folder for false negatives
- `/cu:seed-preferences` — One-time: analyze Zotero + Instapaper history to build initial preferences

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API credentials
2. Install: `pip3 install requests-oauthlib pyyaml`
3. Run `claude` in this directory — all `/cu:*` commands are available
4. Run `/cu:seed-preferences` to initialize from your reading history

## Scripts (reduce token usage)

Use these instead of inline Python — they handle OAuth, parsing, and batch operations:

```bash
# Find the right Python (pixi's python3 may lack deps)
eval "$(bash scripts/find-python.sh)"

# Instapaper API
$CURAITOR_PYTHON scripts/instapaper.py list [--limit N] [--folder archive]
$CURAITOR_PYTHON scripts/instapaper.py text BOOKMARK_ID
$CURAITOR_PYTHON scripts/instapaper.py archive ID [ID ...]

# RSS feeds
$CURAITOR_PYTHON scripts/feeds.py [--days N] [--category CAT]

# Batch write Obsidian notes (faster than individual MCP calls for >10 notes)
echo '[{"path":"Curaitor/Inbox/title.md","frontmatter":{...},"content":"..."}]' | $CURAITOR_PYTHON scripts/write-notes.py

# Pre-fetch article data for review (zero tokens — reads vault directly)
python3 scripts/prefetch-review.py review --include-meta    # Review queue
python3 scripts/prefetch-review.py ignored --days 30 --include-meta  # Ignored
python3 scripts/prefetch-review.py inbox --include-meta     # Inbox

# Workspace setup
bash scripts/setup.sh [review|triage|both]
```

For interactive single-note operations, prefer `mcp__obsidian__write_note` (MCP). For batch triage (>10 articles), use `scripts/write-notes.py`.

## Triage rules

`config/triage-rules.yaml` contains deterministic routing rules that supplement LLM evaluation:
- `inbox_domains`: articles from these domains go straight to Inbox
- `inbox_title_keywords`: title keyword matches → Inbox
- `ignored_title_patterns`: known junk patterns → Curaitor/Ignored
- `source_weights`: Instapaper saves (hand-curated) get higher signal weight than RSS

## Credentials

Load from `.env` in the repo root (gitignored):

```python
from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1Session
import os

creds = {}
env_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath('.')), '.env')
for path in ['.env', os.path.expanduser('~/.instapaper-credentials')]:
    if os.path.exists(path):
        with open(path) as f:
            for line in f:
                if '=' in line and not line.startswith('#'):
                    k, v = line.strip().split('=', 1)
                    creds[k] = v
        break

session = OAuth1Session(
    creds['INSTAPAPER_CONSUMER_KEY'],
    client_secret=creds['INSTAPAPER_CONSUMER_SECRET'],
    resource_owner_key=creds['INSTAPAPER_ACCESS_TOKEN'],
    resource_owner_secret=creds['INSTAPAPER_ACCESS_SECRET'],
)
```

### Instapaper API endpoints
- `POST /api/1/bookmarks/list` — list bookmarks (params: folder_id, limit)
- `POST /api/1/bookmarks/get_text` — get article text (params: bookmark_id)
- `POST /api/1/bookmarks/archive` — archive bookmark (params: bookmark_id)

## Obsidian integration

Articles are stored as notes with structured frontmatter. Access via Obsidian MCP tools.

### Folders
All triage folders live under `Curaitor/` in the Obsidian vault:
- **Curaitor/Inbox/** — high-confidence interesting, ready to read
- **Curaitor/Review/** — uncertain, needs human review
- **Curaitor/Ignored/** — triage agent thinks not interesting (machine classification, reviewable for false negatives)
- **Curaitor/Recycle.md** — dismissed articles (simple unordered list of `- [title](url)` links)
- **Curaitor/Archive/** — human-reviewed and dismissed during `/cu:read`, with audit trail in `Curaitor/Archive/Archive.md`
- **Library/** — permanently saved articles from deep read sessions
- **Topics/** — topic notes with linked articles

### Folder semantics and triage signals
- **Curaitor/Ignored/** is written ONLY by triage/discover agents (machine classification). The review agent reads from it (for `/cu:review-ignored`) and moves articles OUT, but NEVER adds to it.
- **Curaitor/Recycle.md** collects dismissed articles as a simple list of links. Articles arrive here from two paths:
  - `/cu:review`: user dismisses an article from Review → **false positive** (triage was wrong to flag it as uncertain/interesting)
  - `/cu:review-ignored`: user confirms an article was correctly ignored → **true negative** (triage was right)
- **Curaitor/Archive/** is written ONLY by `/cu:read` (human decision after deep reading). Contains `Archive.md` with audit trail.

### Triage quality signals
Every human verdict during `/cu:review` and `/cu:review-ignored` provides a signal about triage quality:
- **True positive**: article kept during review (y, !, t, c, b, r, p, skip) — triage was right to flag it for review
- **False positive**: article recycled during review (n) — triage shouldn't have put this in Review. Agent analyzes WHY and updates preferences to decrease future false-positive rate.
- **True negative** (via `/cu:review-ignored`): user confirms article was correctly ignored → reinforces correct triage behavior
- **False negative** (via `/cu:review-ignored`): user rescues a wrongly-ignored article → agent analyzes WHY and updates preferences to decrease future false-negative rate.

### Note format
```markdown
---
title: "Article Title"
url: https://...
source: instapaper
bookmark_id: 12345
date_triaged: 2026-04-04
category: ai-tooling
verdict: read-now
tags: [ai, dev-tools]
---

## Summary
2-3 sentence summary.

## Verdict: Read Now
Why this is worth reading.
```

Note paths use the `Curaitor/` prefix: `Curaitor/Inbox/{sanitized-title}.md`, etc.

## Three-tier confidence routing

Read `config/reading-prefs.md` before every evaluation:
- **High confidence interested** → Obsidian `Curaitor/Inbox/`
- **Uncertain** → Obsidian `Curaitor/Review/`
- **High confidence not interested** → Obsidian `Curaitor/Ignored/`

In unattended mode (cron), NEVER prompt — uncertain always goes to `Curaitor/Review/`.

## CRITICAL: Do not use AskUserQuestion during review

NEVER use AskUserQuestion during `/cu:review` or `/cu:review-ignored`. It only supports 4 options and interrupts text output mid-sentence. Instead:
- Print all text output completely FIRST
- Then print the verdict menu as plain text
- Wait for the user to type their response as free text

## Interactive review

Menu (printed as text, not AskUserQuestion):
```
!:deep-read  ?:discuss  y:inbox  t:topic  c:clip  b:bookmark  r:zotero  p:post  n:recycle  skip  q:quit
```

Users can type inline commands:
- `! compare this to our current approach` — deep read with context
- `? does this support hg38?` — discuss before deciding
- Or bare keys: `y`, `n`, `c`, `r`, `skip`, `q`

### Verdicts
- **!** — Deep read: save permanently (papers→Zotero, others→Library/), fetch full text, interactive RAG discussion, save discussion notes when done
- **?** — Discuss: fetch full text, answer questions, re-show menu when user says "done"
- **y** — Inbox: move to Curaitor/Inbox/, star GitHub repo if detected, add to Tools & Projects catalog
- **c** — Clip: add repo/tool to Tools & Projects catalog, delete article (only shown when repo/tool detected)
- **r** — Zotero: save as reference via Zotero API
- **n** — Recycle: not keeping. Append `- [title](url)` to `Curaitor/Recycle.md`, delete the note. This is a **false positive** — analyze why triage routed this to Review and update preferences to decrease the false-positive rate.
- **skip** — Leave in Curaitor/Review/
- **q** — Quit, show session summary

### GitHub repo detection
Before opening each article, check if the URL or title contains a GitHub/GitLab repo link. If detected:
- Offer to open the repo instead of the article
- On **y**, **!**, or **c**: star via `gh api user/starred/OWNER/REPO -X PUT`
- Add to `Tools & Projects.md` in Obsidian vault root

### Tools & Projects catalog
Maintained at vault root as `Tools & Projects.md`. Organized by category:
```markdown
## Genomics & Bioinformatics
- [Helicase](https://github.com/owner/helicase) — SIMD-vectorized FASTQ/FASTA parsing

## AI & Development Tools
- [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) — Persistent structured memory for coding agents
```

## cmux browser

For interactive review in [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux):

```bash
# Open URL in browser pane (returns surface:NN)
cmux browser open "https://example.com"

# Navigate existing surface
cmux browser goto "https://new-url.com" --surface surface:NN

# Wait for load
cmux browser wait --load-state complete --surface surface:NN --timeout-ms 5000

# Get DOM snapshot
cmux browser snapshot --compact --surface surface:NN

# Interact with elements (ref IDs from snapshot)
cmux browser click "REF_ID" --surface surface:NN
cmux browser fill "REF_ID" "value" --surface surface:NN
```

Track `surface:NN` from first open, reuse for all subsequent commands. Do NOT use `cmux browse`.

If cmux is not available, fall back to printing the URL for the user to open manually.

## LinkedIn authentication

Many articles are LinkedIn posts requiring login:
- Use Bitwarden CLI if available: `bw get username/password linkedin.com` (requires BW_SESSION)
- Pre-authenticate at session start if LinkedIn URLs are in the review queue
- User may need to approve 2FA via phone

## Auto-tagging and topic linking

### Tagging
When writing ANY Obsidian note (triage, discover, or review), always generate semantic tags from the article content. Tags should be:
- Lowercase, hyphenated (e.g., `variant-calling`, `ai-agents`, `cfDNA`)
- A mix of broad (`genomics`, `machine-learning`) and specific (`bloom-filters`, `nanopore-basecalling`)
- 3-8 tags per article
- Stored in frontmatter `tags` array

### Topic detection
Before finalizing an article note, search Obsidian for existing topic notes that match the article's tags:
1. Use `mcp__obsidian__search_notes` to find notes tagged with the same terms
2. Look in `Topics/` folder for existing topic notes
3. If matching topics are found, mention them when presenting the article:
   ```
   Related topics: [[Variant Calling Methods]], [[AI-Assisted Development]]
   ```

### Topic linking
When a match is found during `/cu:review`:
- Add the topic names to the article note as `related_topics` in frontmatter
- Add `[[wiki-links]]` to the related topics in the note body
- Offer to append a backlink in the topic note (e.g., under a "## Related Articles" section)

When the user asks to "create a new topic" during review:
1. Create a note in `Topics/{Topic Name}.md` with frontmatter tags
2. Add the current article as the first related article
3. Ask the user for a brief description of the topic scope
4. Search Obsidian for other existing articles that match the topic's tags and offer to link them

### Tag consistency
When generating tags, first check what tags already exist in the vault by scanning recent notes. Prefer existing tags over creating new synonyms (e.g., if `variant-calling` exists, don't create `variant-callers`).

## Preference learning

`config/reading-prefs.md` contains natural language rules. After each review verdict, if the decision reveals a genuinely new pattern, append to `## Learned patterns`:
```
- YYYY-MM-DD: [TP|FP|TN|FN] User [interested in / not interested in] [pattern]. Example: "Title". [analysis of why triage was right/wrong]
```
Signal types:
- **TP** (true positive): article kept during `/cu:review` — reinforce correct triage behavior
- **FP** (false positive): article recycled during `/cu:review` — analyze and correct the over-inclusion pattern
- **TN** (true negative): confirmed ignored during `/cu:review-ignored` — reinforce correct ignore behavior
- **FN** (false negative): rescued during `/cu:review-ignored` — analyze and correct the over-exclusion pattern

Only log informative patterns — not every decision.

## Zotero integration

Saves papers via Zotero's local connector API (`localhost:23119`). Setup:
1. Enable local API in Zotero: Preferences > Advanced > "Allow other applications..."
2. Copy `config/zotero.yaml.example` to `config/zotero.yaml` and set your collection

Helper script (reduces token usage):
```bash
python scripts/zotero.py check                          # is Zotero running?
python scripts/zotero.py collections                    # list collections
python scripts/zotero.py save URL --title T --tags t1,t2 --collection C1
python scripts/zotero.py add-note ITEM_KEY "<p>HTML note</p>"
python scripts/zotero.py search QUERY
```

Paper detection: DOI URLs, bioRxiv, arXiv, nature.com/articles, academic.oup.com, springer.com. Non-papers only saved to Zotero on explicit `r` verdict.

## Non-text sources (videos, podcasts)

When triaging or discovering a video (YouTube, Vimeo) or podcast episode:

1. **Detect media type** from URL: `youtube.com`, `youtu.be`, podcasting platforms, `.mp3`/`.mp4` links
2. **Check for transcript**: YouTube auto-generates transcripts (accessible via WebFetch on the page or transcript APIs); podcast feeds often include show notes or linked transcripts
3. **If transcript available**: use it to generate the summary — evaluate the same way as article text
4. **If no transcript but description/show notes exist**: evaluate from those (treat like an RSS abstract)
5. **If neither**: route to `Curaitor/Review/` as uncertain — the user can decide interactively
6. **Frontmatter**: add `media_type: video` or `media_type: podcast` so review agent knows to expect non-text content

During `/cu:review` deep read (`!`), fetch the transcript for RAG discussion rather than the page HTML.

## PDF reading

When the `pdf-reader` MCP server is available (globally installed), use `read_pdf` for fetching full content from PDF-format papers. This extracts text AND images (figures, tables), which is critical for scientific papers where figures carry key information.

Usage: check if `read_pdf` tool is available. If so, prefer it over WebFetch for PDF URLs (DOI, bioRxiv, arXiv, nature.com, academic.oup.com). If not available, fall back to WebFetch or cmux browser snapshot.

## Feeds

`config/feeds.yaml` lists RSS feeds for `/cu:discover`. Add/remove by editing the file.

## Feedly integration

After `/cu:discover` processes RSS articles, mark them as read in Feedly so they don't pile up as unread.

Helper script:
```bash
python3 scripts/feedly.py profile                         # test auth
python3 scripts/feedly.py list STREAM_ID [--unread-only]  # list entries
python3 scripts/feedly.py mark-read STREAM_ID --urls-file FILE
python3 scripts/feedly.py mark-read STREAM_ID --urls URL1 URL2
```

Stream ID for Science feeds: `user/5ebf728d-08d4-4438-a616-2dc84ee1af7b/category/Science - old`

Auth: `FEEDLY_TOKEN` in `.env`. Token is a JWT from Feedly's web session (`localStorage['feedly.session']`). To refresh: log into Feedly in cmux browser, then extract via `cmux browser eval "JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('feedly.session')).feedlyToken"`.

## Scheduling (unattended)

```bash
# Triage Instapaper every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * cd ~/projects/curaitor && claude -p "/cu:triage" --permission-mode bypassPermissions >> ~/curaitor-triage.log 2>&1

# Discover from feeds daily at 6am
0 6 * * * cd ~/projects/curaitor && claude -p "/cu:discover" --permission-mode bypassPermissions >> ~/curaitor-discover.log 2>&1
```
