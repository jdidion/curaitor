# /cu:review — Interactive article review session

Browse articles from the Review queue one at a time in the cmux browser, discuss with Claude, and give feedback.

## Arguments
$ARGUMENTS — Optional: number of articles to review (default: all), or "ignored" to review the Ignored folder.

## Step 1: Load context

1. Read `~/projects/curaitor/config/reading-prefs.md`
2. List notes in `Review/` folder via `mcp__obsidian__list_directory`
3. If $ARGUMENTS is "ignored", list `Ignored/` folder instead

If the queue is empty, tell the user and exit.

## Step 2: LinkedIn pre-authentication

Many Review articles are LinkedIn posts. Check if any articles have linkedin.com URLs. If so, authenticate at the start of the session:

1. Open LinkedIn in cmux browser:
   ```bash
   cmux browser open "https://www.linkedin.com/login"
   ```
2. Track the returned `surface:NN` ID for all subsequent browser commands
3. Use Bitwarden CLI to fill credentials (look up the LinkedIn item in Bitwarden):
   ```bash
   cmux browser fill "EMAIL_REF" "$(bw get username linkedin.com)" --surface surface:NN
   cmux browser fill "PASSWORD_REF" "$(bw get password linkedin.com)" --surface surface:NN
   ```
4. User may need to approve 2FA on their phone — wait for confirmation

Skip this step if no LinkedIn articles in the queue or if BW_SESSION is not set.

## Step 3: Present queue overview

```
Review queue: 18 articles

1. [ai-tooling]  "Optimize LLM Efficiency with Sequencing Tool"
2. [ai-tooling]  "Structural Metadata Reconstruction Attack on LLMs"
3. [ai-tooling]  "Introducing Axion: AI-Friendly Programming Language"
...

Starting with #1.
```

## Step 4: For each article

### a. Read the Obsidian note
Use `mcp__obsidian__read_note` to get the full note including frontmatter.

### b. Detect GitHub/GitLab repos

Before opening, check if the article URL or title contains a GitHub/GitLab repo link:
- URL matches `github.com/{owner}/{repo}` or `gitlab.com/{owner}/{repo}`
- Title contains "GitHub -" or "GitLab -" followed by `{owner}/{repo}`
- Article text/description contains a `github.com/{owner}/{repo}` link

If a repo is detected, extract the `owner/repo` and note it. When presenting the article, offer to open the repo instead:

```
  Repo detected: github.com/steveyegge/beads
  [r] Open repo instead  |  [a] Open article  |  [b] Open both
```

Default to the repo URL for GitHub/GitLab-linked articles.

### c. Open in cmux browser
```bash
cmux browser open "ARTICLE_URL"  # or REPO_URL if user chose [r]
# or if reusing existing surface:
cmux browser goto "URL" --surface surface:NN
cmux browser wait --load-state complete --surface surface:NN --timeout-ms 5000
```

### d. Auto-tag and search for related topics

Generate 3-8 semantic tags from the article content:
- Lowercase, hyphenated (e.g., `variant-calling`, `ai-agents`, `cfDNA`)
- Mix of broad (`genomics`, `machine-learning`) and specific (`bloom-filters`, `nanopore-basecalling`)
- Check existing vault tags first — prefer existing tags over creating synonyms

Then search Obsidian for matching topic notes:
1. `mcp__obsidian__search_notes` for key tags
2. Check `Topics/` folder for notes with matching tags
3. Note any matches for display

### e. Present Claude's assessment
```

```

### f. Ask for verdict

Do NOT use AskUserQuestion — it only supports 4 options max. Instead, print the menu as text and wait for the user to type their response:

```
!:deep-read  ?:discuss  y:inbox  t:topic  c:clip  b:bookmark  r:zotero  p:post  a:archive  skip  q:quit
```

Only include **c** if a repo or tool website was detected. Only include **t** if related topics were found or the article could start a new topic.

The user can type:
- A bare key: `y`, `a`, `c`, `r`, `t`, `skip`, `q`
- **`! <comment>`** — deep read with initial context
- **`? <question>`** — ask a question before deciding
- **`t <topic name>`** — attach to existing topic or create new one
- **`a <reason>`** — archive with a reason (e.g., `a not relevant to current work`)
- Any other free text — treated as a question, answer it, re-show menu

### g. Handle verdict

- **!** → **Deep read mode** (see below). If repo detected: star it and add to Tools catalog.
- **?** → **Discussion mode**: fetch full article text, conversational Q&A loop, re-present verdict when user says "done".
- **y** → move to `Inbox/`, update frontmatter with tags. If repo detected: star it and add to Tools catalog.
- **t** → **Topic mode**: attach article to a topic, then delete from Review/ (article lives under the topic, not separately):
  - If user typed `t` alone and related topics were found: list them, ask which one (or "new")
  - If user typed `t <topic name>`: use that topic (create in `Topics/` if new)
  - Add article as a `[[wiki-link]]` under `## Related Articles` in the topic note
  - Add article URL, title, and summary as a sub-entry in the topic note
  - If repo detected: also star it and add to Tools catalog
  - Delete the article from `Review/` — it's now referenced from the topic, no need to keep separately
- **c** → **Clip**: add repo/tool to `Tools & Projects.md`, star if GitHub, delete article from `Review/`.
- **b** → **Bookmark**: save the link to `Bookmarks.md` in Obsidian vault root (see Bookmark format below), then delete from `Review/`. If `config/user-settings.yaml` has a custom `bookmark_command`, run that instead.
- **r** → save to Zotero via API, move to `Inbox/`, add zotero_key to frontmatter
- **p** → **Post to Slack** (see Post flow below), then archive the article.
- **a** → **Archive**: the user has reviewed this and doesn't want to keep it. Append an entry to `Archive/Archive.md` in Obsidian (see Archive format below), then delete the article from `Review/`. NEVER move articles to `Ignored/` — that folder is only for triage-agent classifications.
- **skip** → leave in `Review/`
- **q** → stop, show session summary

### Post to Slack flow (p)

1. **Prompt for channel**: Print the default channel from `config/user-settings.yaml` (`default_slack_channel`), ask the user to type a channel name, user ID (for DM), or hit enter to accept the default.

2. **Draft the message**: Compose a Slack message with:
   - Article title as a link
   - 1-2 sentence summary
   - Why it's interesting (from Claude's assessment or user's discussion)
   - Tags as hashtags

   Example:
   ```
   *<https://github.com/steveyegge/beads|Beads: A memory upgrade for your coding agent>*
   Persistent structured memory for coding agents using Dolt. Replaces markdown plans with dependency-aware graphs for long-horizon tasks.
   Worth checking out if you're building agentic workflows. #ai-agents #developer-tools
   ```

3. **Present draft to user**: Print the draft and ask the user to edit or approve:
   ```
   Draft message for #ai-general:

   [message text]

   Send as-is (enter), edit (type replacement), or cancel (x)?
   ```

4. **Send**: Use `mcp__slack-mcp__send_slack_message` with the channel and final message text.

5. **Archive**: After posting, append to `Archive/Archive.md` with `Reason archived: Posted to Slack #{channel}`, then delete from `Review/`.

### Bookmark format

`Bookmarks.md` in the Obsidian vault root. Organized hierarchically by category, similar to `Tools & Projects.md`. Each entry is one line:

```markdown
# Bookmarks

## Genomics & Bioinformatics
- [UPDhmm](http://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btag062) — HMM-based UPD detection from NGS trio data
- [Strand-seq and personalized genomics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-026-02548-4) — Nature Genetics perspective

## AI & Development
- [Harness design for long-running apps](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps) — Anthropic engineering post on agent harnesses

## General
- [Unbreaking Software](https://third-bit.com/unbreak/) — Debugging course by Greg Wilson
```

Read the existing `Bookmarks.md` via `mcp__obsidian__read_note`. If it doesn't exist, create it. Append the new entry under the appropriate category. If the category doesn't exist, create it.

**Custom bookmark command**: If `config/user-settings.yaml` has `bookmark_command`, run that instead of writing to Obsidian. Example:
```yaml
# Save to Raindrop.io instead of Obsidian
bookmark_command: "curl -s -X POST 'https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1/raindrop' -H 'Authorization: Bearer $RAINDROP_TOKEN' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"link\": \"$URL\", \"title\": \"$TITLE\", \"tags\": $TAGS}'"
```

### Archive format

`Archive/Archive.md` is a running log of reviewed-and-dismissed articles. Append each archived article as:

```markdown
### {title}
- **URL**: {url}
- **Date reviewed**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
- **Category**: {category}
- **Summary**: {1-2 sentence summary}
- **Questions asked**: {list any questions the user asked during ? or ! mode, or "none"}
- **Reason archived**: {user's reason if provided, otherwise "Reviewed — not keeping"}
```

The review agent should NEVER add articles to `Ignored/`. Only the triage agent (`/cu:triage`, `/cu:discover`) writes to `Ignored/`. The review agent only reads from `Ignored/` (for `/cu:review-ignored`) and moves articles OUT of it.

### f. Star GitHub repos (on y or !)

If a GitHub repo was detected and the user chose `y` or `!`:
1. Star the repo:
   ```bash
   gh api user/starred/OWNER/REPO -X PUT
   ```
2. Get repo description:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO --jq '.description'
   ```
3. Add to the **Tools & Projects** catalog in Obsidian (see below)

For GitLab repos, use the GitLab MCP `gitlab_star_project` if available, otherwise skip starring.

### g. Update Tools & Projects catalog

Maintain `Tools & Projects.md` at the root of the Obsidian vault. This is an organized collection of tools and projects discovered through curaitor.

Read the existing note via `mcp__obsidian__read_note` (path: `Tools & Projects.md`). If it doesn't exist, create it.

Format: organized by category, each entry is one line with name as a link and short description.

```markdown
# Tools & Projects

## Genomics & Bioinformatics
- [Helicase](https://github.com/owner/helicase) — SIMD-vectorized FASTQ/FASTA parsing
- [RabbitVar](https://github.com/LeiHaoa/RabbitVar) — Fast germline + somatic variant caller

## AI & Development Tools
- [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) — Persistent structured memory for coding agents
- [CLI-Anything](https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything) — Make any software agent-native via CLI

## Data & Infrastructure
- [Seqa23](https://github.com/...) — Rust crate for querying genomic files across clouds
```

Append the new entry under the appropriate category. If the category doesn't exist, create it. Keep entries sorted alphabetically within each category.

### e. Deep read mode (!)

When the user types `!`, this means "I'm interested AND I want to read and discuss this right now":

1. **Save permanently:**
   - If it's a paper (DOI, bioRxiv, arXiv, nature.com, etc.): save to Zotero via API
   - If it's a blog/tool/LinkedIn post: move to `Library/` folder in Obsidian (create if needed)

2. **Fetch full content:**
   - WebFetch the full article text
   - For papers: fetch abstract + full text if accessible
   - For GitHub repos: read the README
   - For LinkedIn posts: use cmux browser snapshot to get full DOM content
   - Store the fetched content in working memory for the discussion

3. **Interactive RAG discussion:**
   - Present a structured summary (key findings, methods, implications)
   - Then say: "What would you like to discuss about this article?"
   - Answer user's questions from the article content
   - The user may ask things like:
     - "How does this compare to X?"
     - "Could we use this method in our pipeline?"
     - "What are the limitations?"
     - "Summarize the methods section"
   - Continue the discussion until the user says "done" or "next"

4. **Save discussion notes:**
   - When the user finishes discussing, compile the key points from the conversation:
     - User's takeaways and insights
     - Connections to their work
     - Action items or follow-ups mentioned
   - If saved to Zotero: add as a note on the Zotero entry via API
   - If saved to Obsidian Library/: append a `## Discussion Notes` section to the note with date

5. **Update the Obsidian note** with final verdict and move from `Review/` to `Library/` or `Inbox/`

### f. Update preferences
After each verdict, if the decision reveals a genuinely new preference pattern, append to `~/projects/curaitor/config/reading-prefs.md` under "## Learned patterns":
```
- YYYY-MM-DD: User [interested in / not interested in] [pattern]. Example: "Article Title"
```
Only add patterns that are informative — don't log every decision.

## Step 5: Session summary

```
Review session complete:
  3 → Inbox
  2 → Ignored
  1 → Zotero
  2 → Library (deep read)
  10 remaining in Review queue

Deep reads:
  "Article Title" — 3 discussion notes saved
  "Article Title" — 2 discussion notes saved

Preferences updated:
  + interested in terminal-native AI tools
  + not interested in enterprise SaaS tools
```

## Rules
- Always open the article in cmux browser before presenting
- Wait for user input after each article
- Keep assessments concise — 3-4 sentences max
- If cmux is not available, show the URL for manual opening
- Only update reading-prefs.md when a pattern is genuinely new
- In deep read mode, be thorough — the user wants to engage deeply with the material
- For cmux browser: use `cmux browser open`, `cmux browser goto`, `cmux browser snapshot`, `cmux browser wait` (NOT `cmux browse`)
- Track the surface:NN ID from the first `cmux browser open` and reuse it
